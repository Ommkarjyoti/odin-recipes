         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm. </li>
             <li>Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the lukewarm milk, sugar, salt, cardamom, 4 eggs, and enough flour to make a batter (approximately 2 cups). </li>
             <li>Beat until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add about 3 cups of the flour and beat well; the dough should be smooth and glossy in appearance.</li>
             <li>Add the melted butter or margarine, and stir well. Beat again until the dough looks glossy. Stir in the remaining flour until the dough is stiff. </li>
             <li>Turn out of bowl onto a floured surface, cover with an inverted mixing bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes. </li>
             <li>Knead the dough until smooth and satiny.</li>
             <li>Place in a lightly greased mixing bowl, and turn the dough to grease the top. Cover with a clean dishtowel. </li>
             <li>Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
             <li>Punch down, and let rise again until almost doubled. </li>
             <li>Turn out again on to a floured surface, and divide into 3 parts.</li>
             <li>Divide each third into 3 again.</li>
             <li> Roll each piece into a 12 to 16 inch strip. Braid 3 strips into a loaf. You should get 3 large braided loaves. </li>
             <li>Lift the braids onto greased baking sheets. Let rise for 20 minutes. </li>
             <li> Brush each loaf with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
             <li>Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Check occasionally because the bottom burns easily. </li>
         </ol>
